If you're serious about AI, this is the path you can't ignore.

Agentic AI is shaping the next generation of intelligent systems—ones that don’t just generate content, but 𝘢𝘤𝘵, 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯, and 𝘤𝘰𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘢𝘶𝘵𝘰𝘯𝘰𝘮𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘭𝘺.

I’ve mapped out a complete journey for aspiring AI builders, from the fundamentals of Generative AI all the way to deploying multi-agent systems using tools like 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵, 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗚𝗲𝗻, 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗔𝗜, and more.

What this roadmap covers:

• Core concepts of GenAI, LLMs, and LangChain
• Prompt engineering and foundation models
• RAG system design and advanced pipelines
• Tools like Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama
• No-code and code-first agent building
• Multi-agent collaboration and design patterns
 
Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or product innovator, this roadmap gives you the structured clarity needed to 𝘣𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘥 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘧𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 in 2025.

If you're building with LLMs or Agents—𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗼 𝗳𝗮𝗿? 

Prompt design? RAG complexity? 

Multi-agent coordination?
